## Overview

At the hights level, an Andy X instance is composed under an Andy X Cluster. Clusters can have one or more instances of Andy X which can distribute or replicate data amongst themselves.

In an Andy X Clsuter:

* One or more nodes can handel incoming messages from producers, dispatches messages to consumers, communicates with the Andy X configuration stores to handle various coordination tasks. Nodes stores messages within an embedded storage engine.
* Each node will store messages based on the Cluster configuration, also other nodes will replicate data in async form the distributed node connected to.
* Rafting is custom design for Andy X, from the beginning there is no need for ZooKeeper to coordinate tasks between nodes inside an Andy X Cluster.

The diagram below provides an illustration of an Andy X cluster:

## Nodes

The Andy X message node (message broker) is a statefull component that's responsible for running two other components:

* An HTTP server that exposes a REST API for both administrative tasks and topic lookup for producers and consumers. The producers connect to the nodes to publish messages and the consumers connect to the nodes to consume the messages.
* A dispatcher, which is an asynchronous TCP server over a custom binary protocol used for all data transfers.

Messages are typically dispatched out of a managed memory cache for the sake of performance (which can be configured for topics), *unless* the backlog exceeds the cache size. If the backlog grows too large for the memory-cache, the broker will start reading entities from the storage in the disk.

**Global geo-replication on global tenants, is not supported from Andy X**. The reason is that Andy X supports replication foreach Node, and each replicated nodes can be promoted as Main Nodes and taking place of the Main node if that is off for some reason.

## Clusters

Everything related to Andy X runs under an Andy X Cluster. Clusters, in turn, consist of:

* One or more Andy X Nodes (Brokers),
* Custom Rafting quorum used for cluster-level configuration and coordination,
* Cluster Load Balancer (which can be deployed together with nodes, by defaul is pre-confured within Buildersoft Cloud)

Clusters can be configured in three configurations

* **Distributed Nodes** (also knows as Shards),
* **Replicated Nodes** (also knows as Replicas),
* **Production Nodes** a combination of shards and replicas, each main shard can have multiple replicas (it depends on the number of replicas).

## Metadata store
The Andy X metadata store all the metadata of an Andy X cluster, such as tenant, product, component, topic metadata, node load data, and so on. An*dy X will replicate all metadatas to all nodes connected*. Andy X uses **Andy X Raft** for metadata storage, cluster configuration and coordination. The Andy X Metadata store is bounded inside the Andy X Cluster because of the custom rafting, but in next versions of Andy X, *Metadata store will be able to deploy in a separate service*.

> Andy X with v3.1 will support more metadata backend services, including [FASTER](https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/), [MSSQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019), [REDIS](https://redis.io/) and more.

## Persistent storage

Andy x provides guaranteed message delivery for applications. If a message successfully reaches a Andy X node, it will be delivered to its intended target.

This guarantee requires that Andy X will store messages into Topic store (in-memory and disk combination) in a durable manner until they can be delivered to and acknowledged by consumers. This mode of messaging is commonly called *persistent messaging*. In Andy X, based on the Cluster configuration the message will be stored and synced on disk. for example, if there are 2 distributed nodes, 4 messages will go 2 in first node, and the rest in the last node. After messages are stored in main nodes, they will be replicated into replicated nodes.

Andy X uses a system called RocksDb for persistent message storage. RocksDb is embedded [write-ahead log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging) (WAL) system that provides a lot of different configurations.
